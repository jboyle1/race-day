## Magic Eight Ball Application 

### Description

In this project I will follow Codecademy's tutorial and write a program that will register runners for the race and give them instructions on race day. I will then create the rest of the Javascript interactivity (with query selectiors), HTML and styling myself to develop it into a fully functioning application.


### How it works 

Hereâ€™s how the registration works. There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). They can register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.

Race number:

* Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.
* All others receive a number below 1000.

Start time:

* Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.
  * Early adults run at 9:30 am.
  * Late adults run at 11:00 am.
* Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).
